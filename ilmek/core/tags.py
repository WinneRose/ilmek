"""Morphological tag schema (the public vocabulary of an analysis).

Kept in ``core`` so that both the data model and the morphology engine depend on one
documented vocabulary — never the other way around. Values are UD-aligned where a clean
mapping exists, so CoNLL-U export stays a formatting concern rather than a re-labelling.
